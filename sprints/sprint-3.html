        <h2 class="sub__title">Differences between HTML, CSS</h2>
        <p class="sprint__text">In layman's terms, HTML dictates the content and structure of a 
            webpage, while CSS modifies the visuality of the content and display of the website. HTML comes with a very basic layout structure of font, 
            font size and position of elements, whereas CSS can modify attributes like these hugely, 
            while also adding functionality and animations.</p>
        <h2 class="sub__title">Flow Control & loops</h2>
        <p class="sprint__text">Computers are excellent at performing tasks over and over again, at billions of calculations per second. 
            We can use a loop statement to tell a computer to perform a task over and over again until a criterion has been met. 
            There are many types of loops from while to for to forEach to map, each having their own advantage depending on what you are looping over, 
            you also need to account for memory allocation spent looping over data in your program. All these loops basically checked a boolean condition and if then executes the
             statement until it becomes a falsely value.
                A real-life example of using a loop would be doing a repetitive task over and over. Say you're digging a hole with a spade and you want to dig 
                a hole a meter deep. You're going to start digging and toss the dirt to the other side and use a tape measure to measure the hole until it is 1 meter deep - 
                and then once that condition has been met, then you can stop.</p>
        <h2 class="sub__title">DOM example</h2>
        <p class="sprint__text">One way Javascript can store information is in object format, this is known as Javascript object notation (JSON). 
            As you may know everything in javascript is an object (well almost everything) If we then want to change some data in an object we can do this easily by 
            assigning a new value to this object. Now, enter the document object model (DOM). With the DOM, we can specifically pick a piece of the document markup and convert that to a 
            javascript object, and then change that object using standard methods. We can select this document markup, providing it has a class or id attribute attached by using 
            let class = document.querySelector('.className'); (Note there are more selectors than just this one) Now we have a binding variable, class which means we can communicate between 
            Javascript and the HTML document and amend changes to it.</p>
        <h2 class="sub__title">Accessing data - Arrays/Objects</h2>
        <p class="sprint__text">Objects allow you to store information and created using figure brackets {...} with a list of properties. These properties are 'key-value pairs' 
            in which the key is a string (Something you can access by name) and a value can be anything (boolean, string, number etc). We can imagine an object and a file cabinet 
            containing files in which we can modify and remove. 

                While arrays have almost the same concept, arrays have an ordered collection of elements which each have a corresponding position of each element (0, 1, 2, 3). 
                Arrays are extremely useful in programming as we can loop over them, add new items to the array convert to a string, remove items from it and so much more. 
                Here is an example of accessing data from both arrays and objects.</p>
