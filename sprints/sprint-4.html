            In one of my tasks, specifically 'Gradebook' a very elementary problem I got caught on was instantiating an object 'gradebook' with student objects inside this object 
            and missed an important comma after each student object which was throwing a very simple error which I had missed. When an 'Unidentified error' is thrown, that means there is 
            something missing in your syntax i.e bracket, colon or in my case, a comma. A way I overcame this simple problem was reminding myself of object creation in Javascript and looking at 
            creating objects inside of objects. What did I learn? Go back to the basics and remind yourself of basic syntax. </br>
            And of course.. Code in question.

            With Javascript ES6+ syntax really helps with writing eloquent code in much fewer lines of code. An example of this was in the coding kata challenge 'Built-in methods' 
            in which you're using ES6 methods rather than using a for loop and using old syntax we can write a function to remove the words "Buzz" and "Bizz" from our string using 
            just two lines of code. Which improves performance somewhat and readability. In the example below, this is an example of "method chaining" in which your chaining methods on to a 
            variable or argument and then returning the result back to the function. The thought process behind this function requirement is that first, you need to filter through a list of
             words, then check if that list contains words you don't want to include (this can be checked with a false/not operator !) and return the results back to the function.
