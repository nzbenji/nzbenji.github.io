        <p class="sprint__text">
            In one of my tasks, specifically 'Gradebook' a very elementary problem I got caught on was instantiating an object 'gradebook' with student objects inside this object 
            and missed an important comma after each student object which was throwing a very simple error which I had missed. When an 'Unidentified error' is thrown, that means there is 
            something missing in your syntax i.e bracket, colon or in my case, a comma. A way I overcame this simple problem was reminding myself of object creation in Javascript and looking at 
            creating objects inside of objects. What did I learn? Go back to the basics and remind yourself of basic syntax. </br>
            And of course.. Code in question.

        <p class="sprint__text">
            With Javascript ES6+ syntax really helps with writing eloquent code in much fewer lines of code. An example of this was in the coding kata challenge 'Built-in methods' 
            in which you're using ES6 methods rather than using a for loop and using old syntax we can write a function to remove the words "Buzz" and "Bizz" from our string using 
            just two lines of code. Which improves performance somewhat and readability. In the example below, this is an example of "method chaining" in which your chaining methods on to a 
            variable or argument and then returning the result back to the function. The thought process behind this function requirement is that first, you need to filter through a list of
             words, then check if that list contains words you don't want to include (this can be checked with a false/not operator !) and return the results back to the function.

            <strong>Pseudocode -</strong> Fairly comfortable with writing pseudocode, although sometimes out of bad habit I just dive
            straight in without a plan or strategy which is something to work on. </br>
            <strong>Trying something -</strong> I try to experiment to see what works and what doesn't almost all the time unless
            I'm familiar with what im doing. </br>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method - </strong> Haven't used or got a rubby ducky, althought I try to describe a problem to an imaginary
            person. </br>
            <strong>Reading error messages - </strong> First thing I check is the console and related error and try google if I can't
            figure it out. </br>
            <strong>Console.logging - </strong> All too often. Console logging or debugging in console. </br>
            <strong>Googling - </strong> Pretty comfortable, althought finding the right words to explain can sometimes be a problem. </br>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help - </strong> When required, although not often. </br>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help - </strong> I like to solve most things by myself, but if I do come up stucky 
            majorly I will turn to coaches for assistance. </br>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection - </strong> Reflecting upon what I'm doing more so, which is a 
            weakness.

        <h3 class="subject__title">Neuroplasticity</h3>

        <p class="sprint__text">Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to restructure it's neural connections and allows the nerve cells to adjust their formation coming 
            from a change in their environment such as difficult circumstances. This is how we learn, develop new memories and learn new skills. Research has shown that the neural 
            connections between different regions in the brain can reorganize themselves. In a brain-damaged individual suffering from brain damage to one part of the brain, 
            neuroplasticity can allow a healthy section in the brain to assume control over a damaged section which they can often recover from. 

            Neuroplasticity can be increased by getting enough magnesium, sleep, reduce stress factors, exercise and challenging yourself mentally.
        Such as, learning a new langugage, learning an instrument or even programming!</p>

        <h3 class="subject__title">Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p class="sprint__text">A scientific study was conducted, where a group of children were given a set of math puzzles. Once completed, half the children were told
             'Well done! You're so smart!" while the other half were told "Well done! You tried really hard!" They were then given a second,  more difficult puzzle. When 
             faced with a more difficult problem, the kids that were congratulated for being smart would give up sooner and score lower on the test. While the other kids who were
              congratulated on working hard would perservre and score higher. 

                </p>
        <p class="sprint__text">The way you view yourself almost entirely depends on where you will end up in life. If you don't believe you can change your habits or qualities. 
                In the example above, the kids that were praised on being smart ended up doing worse with the harder puzzles had the fixed mindset.
                
                A growth mindset is about an important belief that any skill can be honed through deliberate practice, changing the way you view failure and become more curious. 
                Accept that you need to put the time and effort into learning something and that nothing happens overnight.</p>
