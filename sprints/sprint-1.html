        <h1 class="main__title">Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
        <p class="sprint__text">A couple of personal attributes I have which can define me are logic, where I can have a logical plan path or steps to get to a specific goal in 
            which I have in mind and dependability in which, my peers and teammates can rely on me to complete or count on me to help with.
                </p>
        <p class="sprint__text"> Coming from a trade background doing a lot of quoting and handling and dealing with finances also, an ethical decision I constantly would have to make is to give 
                        people a very fair rate and not to overcharge and give the best quality work I can do while being a person that the customer would love to recommend and use again.</p>
        <p class="sprint__text">Culture in New Zealand is very interesting, we have a very diverse group of people over the world living in this country and simply talking to them and hearing 
                        about their life can put yourself in their shoes and change the way you think about life in general.</p>
        <p class="sprint__text">I consider and also friends agree, that I have a very happy go lucky personality, in that I'm very down to earth and easy to talk to. Keeping myself focused and 
                        motivated in doing a task that doesn't generally spark an interest with me is a personal and professional limitation of mine.
                        </p>
        <p class="sprint__text">A personal strength of mine which can interact with learning obstacles is perseverance. One thing that life will teach you over and over again is that nothing 
                        worth achieving can be done with ease. You have to show up day after day put in the hours. Another personal strength of mine is patience which I view as incredibly 
                        important to learning in that it's all about the journey and not the destination.</p>
        <p class="sprint__text">An example of when I have tried to work productively with others but there was tension is coming from a background in working in a trade often teaching new apprentices and 
                        starting from scratch and showing them how to be efficient and doing quality and professional work is always a challenge. I try to reassure and encourage these people to 
                        boost their morale and to also work well in a team.</p>
